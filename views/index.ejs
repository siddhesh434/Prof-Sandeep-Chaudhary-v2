        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p itemprop="description">
          SCORE aims to develop sustainable industry ready solutions to the global
          challenges in the field of construction industry and rural development.
          SCORE welcomes the participation of all stakeholders to make this vision
          a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          SCORE has recently expanded its scope of work to focus on rural
          development. This is in light of the fact that two-third of the
          population in India resides in villages. As a part of rural development
          SCORE is also working towards livelihood creation, clean energy and
          sanitation.
